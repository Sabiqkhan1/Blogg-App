# Blogg-App

Dependacies 

Install node
(for node modules)



I have created a login and register form using FormGroup and Form control. Once registered your data will be stored onto the login.json file. 
To access and run REST API run command :

json-server login.json


Please also run command:

Json-server blog.json

This will also open the rest API where all the blogs are stored. 

After Logging in, you will get access to the admin dashboard. Here you can Add new blog post and will be stored into the table. You can then read blog post, delte or update blog post. 

Using Angular Router you will be able to access the contact us page and will be presented with a form to complete. You can naviigate bvack to home page using the homepage button also used with angular Router.
